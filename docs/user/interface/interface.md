## Home page
---
When opening Silex, you just need to connect with your Kitsu acount.
after that, the home page will be displayed.

![](/img/user_guide/home_page/silex_home_page.png)

There are three main parts to this home page.

### The bottom part :

It displays shortcuts to shots / assets / projects :

![](/img/user_guide/home_page/silex_home_page_frame_bottom.png)

- The **left** side is for the project your are a part of. By clicking on one of them, you will be redirected to the [file explorer](file-explorer.md) within Silex, where you will be able to browse through the project.

- The **center** and the **right** side, are shortcuts to the recently opend tasks and scenes.

:::tip
If you are a specialist, you probably have multiple projects on the left. If you ever need to be added to another project during the year, go and ask a TD to add you to a group (They are very nice, you'll see).

### The middle part :

This is a quick access to the _hamberger_ menu on the top left corner (in yellow on the picture). On the right side, you can also access the [conform](../basic-concepts/actions/actions.md) action for simple files like textures. ( ⚠️ This conform action will not work with Houdini and Maya files ⚠️ )
