Hello newbie ! üññ

Welcome to Silex, a pipeline application which gives you access to the render farm and allows you to browse through your shots and assets and many other things ! (you will see it's very fun)

When opening silex, you just need to connect with your kitsu acount.
after that, the home page will be displayed.

There are three main parts to this home page.

### The bottom part :

It displays shortcuts to shots / assets / projects :

- The **left** side is for the project your are a part of. by licking on one, you will be redirected to the [file explorer](file-explorer.md) within silex, where you wil be able to browse through the project.

- The **center** end **right** side, are shortcuts to the recently opend tasks and scenes.

:::tip
If you are a specialist, you might have multiple projects on the left. If you ever need to be added to another project during the year, go and ask a TD to add you to a group.

### The middle part :

This is a quick access to the _hamberger_ menu on the top left corner in yellow. On the right side you can also access the conform action for simplpe files like textures. ( ‚ö†Ô∏è This conform action will not work with Houdini and Maya files ‚ö†Ô∏è )
