Hello newbies ! üññ

Welcome to Silex, a pipeline application which gives you access to the render farm and allows you to browse through your shots and assets, and many other things ! (you'll see, it's very fun)

When opening silex, you just need to connect with your kitsu acount.
after that, the home page will be displayed.

There are three main parts to this home page.

### The bottom part :

It displays shortcuts to shots / assets / projects :

![](../../../static/img/user_guide/home_page/silex_home_page_frame_bottom.png)

- The **left** side is for the project your are a part of. By clicking on one of them, you will be redirected to the [file explorer](file-explorer.md) within silex, where you will be able to browse through the project.

- The **center** and the **right** side, are shortcuts to the recently opend tasks and scenes.

:::tip
If you are a specialist, you probably have multiple projects on the left. If you ever need to be added to another project during the year, go and ask a TD to add you to a group (They are very nice, you'll see).

### The middle part :

This is a quick access to the _hamberger_ menu on the top left corner (in yellow on the picture). On the right side, you can also access the [conform](../basic-concepts/actions/actions.md) action for simple files like textures. ( ‚ö†Ô∏è This conform action will not work with Houdini and Maya files ‚ö†Ô∏è )
