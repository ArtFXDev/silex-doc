# Convert scene to another task

Situation : You are a FX artist, you have done an FX for the shot s01p010 but you wan to use it as a base for your s01p020 shot.

1 : Open your s01p010 FX scene.             

2 : [Save](../actions/save.md) your scene **and** increment save your scene. Your scene name must be the name of your initial scene (in our example, s01p010 fx).

The tool ask you to wich task you want to convert your current scene. In my example, I select the s01p020 FX task.

4 : Finally, [save](../actions/save.md) again with the silex save tool. Now, your scene is set for another task, at the right place in the pipeline.
