The file explorer allows you to browse your projects.

Here is what it looks like :

This is the view of your sequences but you can also access your assets in the menu :

For specialist students with multiple projects, you can also switch projects.

## Browsing through files :

When you click on a sequence, you will get "inside" it et access your shots. Exactly like a Windows file explorer.

when selecting a **Shot** or an **Asset**, however, you will see a window displayed on you screen. This window shows the content of your work and publish folder, as well as a screen shot of you scene (If you took one when publishing it)

You can switch from the **Work** folder to the **Publish** folder here :

And Pull a published file from the **Publish** to the **Work** folder :

(for more info on work and publish, see : workflow)

In the **Work** folder, you can either open a new scene or an already existing one.
