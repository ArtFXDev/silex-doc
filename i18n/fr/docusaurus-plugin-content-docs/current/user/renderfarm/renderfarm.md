## Introduction
Welcome to the documentation for our renderfarm, a powerful tool that significantly improves your rendering experience by freeing up the computing power needed to bring your final projects to life. This renderfarm uses [**Deadline**](deadline.md), a highly scalable and flexible rendering management solution.

## What is a Renderfarm?
A renderfarm is a network of machines specially configured to accelerate the rendering process in graphics production, whether for animations, visual effects, still images or other multimedia content. Instead of relying on a single machine, a renderfarm distributes the rendering load across several machines in parallel, dramatically reducing the time needed to generate high-quality images.
